                    <h3>My story</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Although my education was not specialized in IT, since high school, I had several courses in programming and IT, which was enough to start my career as a QA engineer. In four years, I’ve got great experience in product life cycle management, quality assurance, team communication and march other useful qualities. So after my graduation, I decided to devote my career to IT business and apply my theoretical knowledge in psychology to the business environment familiar to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve spent several years in a startup learning a lot about customer development processes as like searching and building relationships with business representatives, exploring their needs and providing information to tech specialists. Then I managed internal administrating operations in large and highly successful Fintech company. More recently, I had a leading role in a technological platform for advertising management. I collaborated with IT team, promote and accounting departments from our company side also with advertisers agencies from the customer’s side. <br>
                            I realized that the best technological product is a combination of in-depth knowledge of customer needs, awareness of new IT possibilities and financial calculation. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, after moving to Finland, I’m looking forward to developing my career further on the international level. I want to be a part of a diverse team and learn by professionals in their field. I can successfully combine various tasks. I think my strong point is to be fearless to do something new. I think my experience and courage can be useful in creating and launching a new product or business from scratch, but I’m also happy to join an established project and progressive team.
